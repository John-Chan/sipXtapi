<h1>TODOs</h1>

<p>Well defined TODOs are either managed in the issue tracker under <a 
	href="http://track.sipfoundry.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10002&amp;report=roadmap"> 
	Roadmap</a> or in the source code by leaving <code>TODO</code>s in 
	comments. This page is meant the help track some ideas, encourage 
	collaboratation in development projects with similiar agendas and spark 
	some dialog on mailing list.</p>

<p>All the changes that we introduce in sipXconfig code are the results of 
	implementing user requirements. We do not change sipXconfig architecture 
	without a user story to be implemented. Every change has a
	corresponding JIRA issue. The long term goal of the team is to make 
	sipXconfig simpler, more testable and easier to extend. On this page we 
	maintain a registry of ideas of how to get closer to this goal. We may 
	choose to implement some of those opportunistically or, if we deem it 
	important enough, we may dedicate a spring to implement some of them. 
	Placing items on this list does not however constitute any type of 
	commitment on sipXconfig team. <br/> </p>

<h2>Remove or reduce JDOM dependency</h2>
<p>We probably do not need to use JDOM: at least not as widely as we currently do. 
In most case we use it to generate snippets of XML.That should be replaced with a template generator (Velocity or similar).
In other cases, where we parse XML using JDOM, we can probably replace it with XLT.
</p>

<h2>Normalize database</h2>
<p>
We currently keep in our database information that can be easily recreated. As a result when device or user data changes we have to regenerate (fix) the database contents.
It looks like it was done to improve the performance of publishing process (which seems strange - performance of UI seems to be more important).
We may be better off generating this kind of data on demand (instead of keeping in database). However we need to have performance test before we try it to change it.
</p>

<h2>Replace ProfilePublisher with sipXpublisher Plugin</h2>
<p>ProfilePublisher handles <code>SIP SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY</code>
	messages for event type <code>config</code>.  sipXpublisher does the same
	this for MWI (voicemail) and already has plugin architecture.  Challenge, 
	is one's in java and postgres, other is in C++ and IMDB so port won't
	be clear-cut.</p>
