usage: sipxcallresolver.sh [--start "time" [--end "time"]] [--daily] [--help]

  --start "time"  Specifies the start time of the window in which calls are to 
                  be resolved.
  --end "time"    Specifies the end time of the window in which call are to be
                  resolved.
  --daily         Indicates that the call resolver is called in "daily" mode:
                  * Create CDRs for calls in the previous 24 hours
                  * Purge CSE and CDR data older than 35 days
                  You can change the purge age by setting the configuration
                  parameter SIP_CALLRESOLVER_PURGE_AGE_CDR (units are days).
                  In daily mode, the "start" and "end" args are not used.
  --daemon        Makes sipXcondig resolver to stay active after processing initial 
                  batch of CSE records. New records are processed as they appear.
