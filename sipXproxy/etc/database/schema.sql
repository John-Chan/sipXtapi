 *         received that does not have a tag parameter on the TO field value.
 *   'S' - Call Setup, generated when an ACK is received.
 *   'E' - Call End, generated by any BYE request.
 *   'T' - Call Transfer, generated by an REFER request.
 *   'F' - Call Failure, generated by any 5xx or 6xx response to an INVITE
 *         request, or any 4xx response to an INVITE - except
 *                    
 *           401 Authentication Required

---------------------------------- CDR Tables ----------------------------------

/*
 * The cdrs table records info about SIP calls.
 *
 * Start, connect, and end times are nullable to allow for partial CDRs where the
 * call cannot be completely analyzed.  For example, if we can't find a BYE or 
 * any other end event, then the end_time is indeterminate and will be set to NULL.
 *
 * Declaring call_id to be unique implicitly creates an index on that column, so
 * queries on call_id are fast.
 *
 * The termination code column holds an single char value indicating why the call
 * was terminated.  Codes are:
 * 
 *   R: call requested -- got a call_request event, but no other events.
 *   I: call in progress -- got both call_request and call_setup events.
 *   C: successful call completion -- call_request, call_setup, and call_end with
 *      no errors.
 *   F: call failed -- an error occurred.
 */

  id serial8 not null primary key,
  call_id text not null unique,     /* SIP call ID from the INVITE */
  from_tag text not null,           /* SIP from tag provided by caller in the INVITE */
  to_tag text not null,             /* SIP to tag provided by callee in the 200 OK */

---------------------------------- Views ----------------------------------

/*
 * Simplify the presentation of CDRs by showing commonly used CDR data in a
 * single view.
 * Do not include SIP dialog info in the view since it is not of interest for
 * billing.  Dialog info is only used to link the CDR back to raw CSE data,
 * or for CDR post-processing.

---------------------------------- Plugins ----------------------------------

/*
 * Call Direction
 */

/*
 * "Call direction" is an application-level plugin. 
 * The purist approach would be to put call direction in its own table, separate 
 * from the cdrs table, but that would be overkill just for a single char(1) column.
 * So this column is in the cdrs table, see above.
 *
 * Call direction is encoded in char(1) as follows: 
 *
 *   Incoming (I): for calls that come in from a PSTN gateway
 *   Outgoing (O): for calls that go out to a PSTN gateway
 *   Intranetwork (A): for calls that are pure SIP and don't go through a gateway
 */

/*
 * Define "view_cdrs_with_call_direction" to be a superset of "view_cdrs" defined 
 * above, with the addition of the call_direction column.
