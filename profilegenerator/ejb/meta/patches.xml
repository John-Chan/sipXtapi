  - Patches.currentVersion - should be set to the version of the newly created database.
  -    it is only taken into account when a new database is initialized (see: createDatabaseVersionRecord)
  -
  - All patches for DB version number (inclusive) or newer are taken into account when patching.
  - Patches that were already applied have records in the PATCHES table, and thus are skipped during updates.
  -
  - currentVersion should be incremented every time patches content is moved into database creation
