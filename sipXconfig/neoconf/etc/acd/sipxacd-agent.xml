      <description>The list of ACD Queues that this agent is assigned to. The ACD Queues are identified via a
        comma-separated list of acd-queue identifiers.  The order is relevant as it specifies the priority of
        the queues in respect to which queue the agent will service should multiple queues attempt to
        simultaneously route a call to it.  The first element in the list is of highest priority.</description>
