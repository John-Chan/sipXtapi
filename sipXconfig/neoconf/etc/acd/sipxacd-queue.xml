      <description>If set to Immediate, the call will be answered immediately upon arriving at this queue and
        the configured welcome-audio file will be played to the caller. Once the audio has completed, the queue
        will then attempt to route the call. If set to Deferred, the queue will first attempt to route the call. If
        it is unable to immediately route the call, it will then be answered. If set to Never, the call will not be
        answered while on this queue other than when actually connecting to an agent.</description>

      <description>The name of an acd-audio object that will be used to source audio to the caller when it has been
        determined that the call must be terminated. Once the audio has completed, the call will be dropped. If no

      <description>The duration, in seconds, that the termination tone (busy tone) is to be played if no
        call-termination-audio is specified and the call is to be dropped by the queue. A value of zero indicates

      <description>The list of ACD Agents that are assigned to this queue.  The queue will attempt to route calls
        that it is processing to one or more of the listed agents based upon the agent availability and the queue
        routing policy. The order of agents in the list is relevant in respect to call routing when the call
        routing scheme for this queue is set to Linear.</description>
