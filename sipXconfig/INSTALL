INSTALL FROM RPMS

For Fedora Core 3, and soon Fedora Core 4, you can download and install
sipXconfig RPMs from http://www.sipfoundry.org/pub/sipX/.

INSTALL FROM SOURCE

For other LINUX distributions (as well as Fedora), you can download sipXconfig
source and build the product yourself.  If you have obtained source code from
subversion and not from a tar file, then run these commands:

    autoreconf -if
    ./configure
    make all check install

Then you need to run this one command to initialize the database, once ever as root:

  su - root
  sipxconfig.sh --setup

See the above wiki page for more information.
