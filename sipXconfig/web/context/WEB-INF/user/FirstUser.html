    <h2>New Superadmin User</h2>		
    <div class="help">
		<p>Provide a PIN (password) for the new "superadmin" user account, the first user
		   to be created. The superadmin has special administrative privileges, so it is
		   important to choose a secure alphanumeric PIN
		   that cannot be easily guessed.  For example, "ch33zeW1z" is a better PIN
		   than "dog" or "123".</p>
		<p>PINs for non-admin users are typically numeric because numbers are easier to 
		   dial on a phone keypad.  However, the superadmin account is generally used for
		   administering sipXconfig via the web, where this is not an issue.</p>
