title=Dial Plans
quick.help=<p>Dial plans consist of various types of dial rules. \
	You can configure dial plans by adding, removing, editing, or reordering \
          rules. It is possible to have more than one rule of each kind.</p>\
        <p>Rule order matters: Make sure that more specific rules precede more \
        general rules. For example, move Long Distance rules for \
          specified area codes above the default Long Distance rule.</p>
