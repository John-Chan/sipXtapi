<h1>Implementation ideas</h1>

<p>All the changes that we introduce in sipXconfig code are the results of implementing user requirements.
We do not change sipXconfig architecture without a user story to be implemented. Every change has a its corresponding JIRA issue.
The long term goal of the team is to make sipXconfig simpler, more testable and easier to extend. 
On this page we maintain a registry of ideas of how to get closer to this goal.
We may choose to implement some of those opportunistically or, if we deem it important enough, we may dedicate a spring to implement some of them.
Placing items on this list does not however constitute any type of commitment on sipXconfig team.

<h2>Simplify database access</h2>
<p>Currently we use mixture of SQL (JDBC) on container managed persistence - it's hard to maintain. Use only method to access database. Standardize on one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>EJB container managed persistence</li>
<li>Java DAO or similar</li>
<li>object persistence framework</li>
</ul>


<h2>Remove or reduce JDOM dependency</h2>
<p>We probably do not need to use JDOM: at least not as widely as we currently do. 
In most case we use it to generate snippets of XML.That should be replaced with a template generator (Velocity or similar).
In other cases, where we parse XML using JDOM, we can probably replace it with XLT.
</p>

<h2>Normalize database</h2>
<p>
We currently keep in our database information that can be easily recreated. As a result when device or user data changes we have to regenerate (fix) the database contents.
It looks like it was done to improve the performance of publishing process (which seems strange - performance of UI seems to be more important).
We may be better off generating this kind of data on demand (instead of keeping in database). However we need to have performance test before we try it to change it.
</p>

<h2>Use HTTPUnit</h2>
<p>Use HTTPUnit for regression and performance testing of the UI.</p>

<h2>Define local interfaces for entity beans</h2>
<p>Entity beans are accessed locally only in sipXconfig. In spite of that they have only remote interfaces defined.
We could significantly improve the performance of the application, if we replaced the remote interfaces for entity beans with local ones.
Even if we do in fact access those beans remotely adding local interfaces would help with majority of the cases where entity 
beans act as a back end for a facade of session beans (A.K.A advocate beans).
The same maybe true about session beans.</p>

<h2>Update JBoss</h2>
<p>Update code to current version of JBoss. 
Clearly delineate code that depends on JBoss server from container independent code. 
Consider removing dependency on JBoss in favor of some lighter weight container.</p>
