NOTES:

 - jars w/o version numbers are generaly APIs and only contain
   interfaces. Otherwise all jars should contain jar version
   numbers.
   
 - jasper-runtime and jasper-compiler are only included for
   unittesting with jetty.  Attempts to use jars from tomcat
   5.0 failed complaining of multiple instances for commons
   logger which may be resolved with more effort. Eventhough
   web application does not use JSPs, from what I saw in 
   jetty:WebApplicationContext.java:428, loading the jasper jsp
   servlet cannot be turned off.
