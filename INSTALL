                                 Installation

Required Software

   sipXportLib (same version sipXconfig)
          [1]http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXportLib

   sipXtackLib (same version sipXconfig)
          [2]http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXtack

   sipXcommserverLib (same version sipXconfig)
          [3]http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXcommserverLib

   Java SDK 1.4 (tested w/1.4.2.03)
          [4]http://java.sun.com

   postgres 7.3 (tested with 7.3.4)
          [5]http://www.postgresql.org/

   JBoss 2.4.4 with Tomcat 4.0.1 (exactly this version!)
          [6]http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/jboss/JBoss-2.4.4_Tomcat-
          4.0.1.zip

   Ant 1.6 (tested with 1.6.1)
          [7]http://ant.apache.org/

Environment Variables

   After installing these packages, set the following environment
   variables:

   JAVA_HOME
          to where you installed java. This setting is just used to
          compile. After installation the sipx-config --jdk is used to
          find java dynamically. That means you can upgrade your java and
          not break your installation

       Example:
           export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.2_03


   ANT_HOME
          where you unzipped (e.g. installed) ant

       Example:
            export ANT_HOME=~/apache-ant-1.6.2


   JBOSS_HOME
          where you unzipped JBoss

       Example:
          export JBOSS_HOME=~/JBoss-2.4.10_Tomcat-4.0.6


Special Software Installion Instructions

  JBoss

   After unzipping JBoss
    1. run this patch on it
      patch -d ${JBOSS_HOME} -p1 < sipx-jboss-configure.patch
    2. be sure user running sipxpbx (most cases sipxchange) has full r/w
       access to all files and directories in ${JBOSS_HOME}

Installation

   After building the prerequisite components, build sipXconfig by:
     ./configure
     make
     make install

Set up the Postgresql Database

   Edit postgres config files to work. This will open up TCP connections
   and allow localhost to connect to posgres
     /usr/local/sipx/bin/sipxdbmgr --setup
     /usr/local/sipx/bin/sipxdbmgr --create PDS
     /usr/local/sipx/bin/sipxdbmgr --create SDS

Arrange for Postgres to start automatically

   Since sipX needs Postgres to work, it helps if you configure your
   system to start Postgres automatically (usually in runlevels 3 and
   5).  In Red Hat distributions, "chkconfig --level 35 postgresql on"
   will do it.  (In Red Hat Enterprise, the service is called "rhdb"
   instead of "postgresql".)  In other distributions, you may have to
   create the /etc/rc?.d/{S85,K15}postgresql links yourself.

SSL Initialization

   Set up an SSL key using the instructions in
   sipXcommserverLib/doc/INSTALL.ssl.

Optional SOAP Access

   A SOAP API is available to automate adding/deleting and limited
   editing of phone configuration information. In particular user lines,
   devices and credentials.

   A SOAP client perl script is provided as an example and as a useful
   importing utility. See following directory for scripts and examples:
   profilegeneration/soap/bin

Compiling the Profile Publisher's SIP agent w/ MSVC 6

   Support for windows is experimental, here's the latest know
   instructions that were known to work, you may have to play around with
   it, please submit your findings and patches back to mailing list

   First, see the INSTALL instructions in sipXportLib on adding glib and
   pcre to the MSVC 6 environment. Next, you must add Java's JNI include
   and library paths to your MSVC 6 environment following the same
   process.

   Assuming that you installed the SDK in C:\Program
   Files\Java\j2sdk1.4.2_03 you will need to add the following:

   Additional Includes:
          C:\Program Files\Java\j2sdk1.4.2_03\include
          C:\Program Files\Java\j2sdk1.4.2_03\include\win32

   Additional Libs:
          C:\Program Files\Java\j2sdk1.4.2_03\lib
