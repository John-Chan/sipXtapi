<h1>Neoconf</h1>
 
<p>Neoconf is the codename for a new module created
	to evolve the system's architecture over time. It
	uses more modern J2EE technologies, namely the 
	Spring Framework in an interesting way to stage the
	evolution across various 6 month releases.  
	</p>
	
<p>Various architectures were explored on how to integrate this into the 
	existing system and one approach came forward as the best approach. The 
	neonconf will be packaged as a WAR (Web Application) and deployed by 
	current JBoss Application Server. This application will only share data 
	with the current application thru the database. Serving URL will be 
	<code>http://machine-name:8080/neoconf</code> and the current system will 
	still be on <code>http://machine-name:8080/pds</code>.</p>
	
<p>Adding support for Polycom phones will be the first major feature to be
	based completely on neoconf module.  See more information about this
	project on the <a href="polycom.html">polycom page</a>.</p>
