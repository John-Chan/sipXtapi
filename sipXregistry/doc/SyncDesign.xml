    <section title="Motivation and Overview">
      <t> For large systems, defined as PBXs with more than a few dozen users, high
        availability (HA) for basic calling is essential: users should be able to make and
        receive phone calls reliably at all times. HA for voice mail, and perhaps some other
        services, is a lower priority although still important. </t>
      <t>
        <spanx style='strong'> In order to deliver HA as quickly as possible, we will start
          by implementing only those features that are absolutely required. The first HA
          implementation in sipXpbx release 3.2 will only address basic calling. Automated
          installation will not be supported; some custom, manual configuration will be
          required. No more than 2 registrars will be allowed. </spanx>
      </t>
      <t> In sipXpbx, basic calling depends on three components: the two proxies and the
        registrar/redirect service. The proxies can be replicated and DNS SRV records can be
        used to share load and provide for failover. The registrar/redirect service,
        however, cannot currently be deployed on multiple servers because the 'soft' state
        in the registry database (mappings from registered Addresses to Contacts) cannot be
        shared. While replicating the proxies alone does help with scaling, the registrar is
        a single point of failure for basic calling service. </t>
      <t> This memo describes a system architecture to provide high availability service for
        basic calling, by adding the required replication of registration information.

    <section title='High Availability Architecture' anchor='arch'>
      <t>
        In an HA configuration, there are at least two types of Server:

      <list style='symbols'>
        <t>one Master Server running:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>forking proxy</t>
          <t>authentication proxy</t>
          <t>registrar/redirect service</t>
          <t>config service</t>
          <t>vxml service with applications</t>
          <t>publisher (status server)</t>
          <t>presence</t>
        </list>
        </t>
        <t>one or more Distributed Servers, each running:
        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>forking proxy</t>
          <t>authentication proxy</t>
          <t>registrar/redirect service</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Other PBX Services may be distributed among the above Servers,
        or run on other Servers:
      </t>
      <t>
        <spanx style='strong'>
          In Release 3.2, only one configuration will be supported: one
          Distributed Server running only the proxies and registrar/redirect
          service, and one Master Server running all Services.
        </spanx>
      </t>

      <t>
        In order to provide load sharing and failover, all SIP message
        routing to any redundant element in an HA configuration uses DNS
        SRV records.  The following SRV records are required:

      <list style='hanging'>
        <t hangText='domain'>
          In a single-system installation, an SRV record that maps the SIP
          domain name to the Server host name is recommended.  In an HA
          installation, multiple SRV records for the SIP domain name are
          required, mapping to the Server names/ports that run the forking proxy
          service.  There are domain SRV records specifying both TCP and
          UDP (with TCP given preference).  For example:

       <figure>
         <artwork>
      $ORIGIN example.com.

      _sip._tcp IN SRV   1 50 5060 sipxpbx1
      _sip._tcp IN SRV   1 50 5060 sipxpbx2

      _sip._udp IN SRV 101 50 5060 sipxpbx1
      _sip._udp IN SRV 101 50 5060 sipxpbx2
         </artwork>
       </figure>
        </t>
        <t hangText='registrar'>
          The <spanx style='verb'>forwardingrules.xml</spanx> for each
          forking proxy service specifies the registrar using an SRV name
          that maps first to the registrar instance on the same Server as
          the proxy (which is quicker to reach and more likely to be
          operational), and then to the registrar instance on the other
          Server (for failover).
          
          The registrar
          service SRV records specify only TCP, because TCP has better
          failure detection and performance characteristics and
          compatibility with User Agents is not required.  

       <figure>
         <artwork>
     _sip._tcp.sipxregistrar1 IN SRV 1 50 5070 sipxpbx1
     _sip._tcp.sipxregistrar1 IN SRV 2 50 5070 sipxpbx2

     _sip._tcp.sipxregistrar2 IN SRV 1 50 5070 sipxpbx2
     _sip._tcp.sipxregistrar2 IN SRV 2 50 5070 sipxpbx1
         </artwork>
       </figure>
        </t>
       <t>
         In the example above, the forking proxy on
         <spanx style='verb'>sipxpbx1</spanx> would
         be configured to use <spanx
         style='verb'>sipxregistrar1</spanx>, which
         preferentially routes to <spanx style='verb'>sipxpbx1:5070</spanx>
         and fails over to
         <spanx style='verb'>sipxpbx2:5070</spanx>.
         The forking proxy on <spanx style='verb'>sipxpbx2</spanx> is
         configured to use
         <spanx style='verb'>sipxregistrar2</spanx>,
         which uses the two Services in the reverse order.
       </t>

       <t hangText='authproxy'>
          The <spanx style='verb'>forwardingrules.xml</spanx> for each
          forking proxy service specifies the authorization proxy
          using a specialized SRV name configured similarly to the SRV
          name for the registrar.
          The
          authorization proxy SRV records specify both TCP and UDP,
          preferring TCP, but allowing UDP for compatibility with User
          Agents that require it.  (The authorization proxy may be
          Record-Routed in dialogs.)

       <figure>
         <artwork>
      _sip._tcp.sipxauthproxy1 IN SRV   1 50 5080 sipxpbx1
      _sip._tcp.sipxauthproxy1 IN SRV   2 50 5080 sipxpbx2
      _sip._udp.sipxauthproxy1 IN SRV 101 50 5080 sipxpbx1
      _sip._udp.sipxauthproxy1 IN SRV 102 50 5080 sipxpbx2

      _sip._tcp.sipxauthproxy2 IN SRV   1 50 5080 sipxpbx2
      _sip._tcp.sipxauthproxy2 IN SRV   2 50 5080 sipxpbx1

        </t>
       <t>
         The selection technique used to create a preference order for
         registrars is also used for the authproxy, except that SRV
         records for UDP access are also provided, at lower priority
         than all the SRV records for TCP access.
       </t>

       <t>
         <spanx style='strong'>
           Currently, when the authproxy Record-Routes itself, it
           specifies its IP address in the Record-Route header.
           The authproxy could insert a Record-Route that specifies its SRV
           name (as detailed above); doing so would allow
           the processing of in-dialog requests to fail over 
           from one instance to another.
           Whether or not the authproxy should do this depends on
           whether or not user agents support DNS names in Route
           headers.
           Testing is required to determine the best method for Record-Routing.

      <t>
        This section describes the operation of the registrar in
        sipXpbx version 3.0. It does not describe HA changes, or
        the changes for GRUU support.
      </t>

      <section title='REGISTER Request Updates' anchor='applyRegisterToDirectory'>

        <t>
          Updating the registry is handled by the routine
          SipRegistrarServer::applyRegisterToDirectory and the sipbdb
          RegistrationDB class.  The applyRegisterToDirectory method is called
          after the REGISTER request has been authenticated; it validates the
          registration by checking to see if the Call-ID and CSeq are in
          sequence by calling RegistrationDB::isOutOfSequence.
        </t>

        <t>
          applyRegisterToDirectory then parses and validates the contacts
          and expiration time in the
          request and converts them to an internal list.
        </t>

        <t>
          If the request is valid, there are two cases: expiring all
          contacts, and updating contacts.

        <list style='hanging'>

          <t hangText='Expiring All Contacts' anchor='expall'>
            If the REGISTER request had an
            '<spanx style='verb'>Expire:&nbsp;0</spanx>' header and 
            just a '<spanx style='verb'>Contact:&nbsp;*</spanx>' header
            then it is requesting that all contacts for this Address
            Of Record (not just those from this
            Call-ID) be expired.  This is done using a single call to:

          <figure>
            <artwork>
     RegistrationDB::expireAllBindings(aor, callid, cseq, timeNow )
            </artwork>
          </figure>

            The last three arguments to expireAllBindings are not used
            to select which bindings to operate on.  (All bindings for
            the given AOR are expired.)  Rather, they are used for
            marking the bindings as expired -- Bindings are expired by
            setting their expiration time to "timeNow minus 1 second", and
            setting their "last updated by" information to the Call-ID
            and CSeq specified.
          </t>

          <t hangText='Updating Contacts' anchor='upCont'>
            The other case is when there are real contacts in the
            set.  All contacts which are listed are
            to have their expiration times updated, and all other
            contacts which have last been updated with by REGISTERs
            with this Call-ID are to be expired.
          </t>
          <t>
            The listed contacts are updated by calling
            RegistrationDB::updateBinding on each contact:

          <figure>
            <artwork>
      RegistrationDB::updateBinding(toUrl, 
                                    contact,     
                                    qvalue,
                                    registerCallidStr, 
                                    registerCseqInt,
                                    expirationTime 
                                    )
            </artwork>
          </figure>

            Each contact has its q-value and expiration time set, and the
            Call-ID and CSeq are recorded as its "last updated by" information.
          </t>
          <t>
            After all the contacts in the REGISTER message have been updated,
            any contacts that have the same Call-ID but an earlier CSeq
            number are expired by a single call to:

          <figure>
            <artwork>
              RegistrationDB::expireOldBindings(toUrl, 
                                                registerCallidStr,
                                                registerCseqInt, 
                                                timeNow
                                                )

          Other than the locks internal to FastDB, there are no locks on

      </section>
      
      <section title='Primary and Replicated Registrars'>
        <t>
          Every REGISTER request is processed by the registrar that first receives it,
          which is called the Primary Registrar for that REGISTER request.  The Primary Registrar
          is said to "own" that registration and the records describing it (in every
          registrar database). Each Primary Registrar has a set of Replicated Registrars
          to which it replicates all registrations owned by that Primary
          Registrar.  Replication is always symetric and always 'fully meshed' - all registrars for
          a domain replicate to all other registrars for that domain.  A
          Replicated Registrar is also referred to as a "Peer" registrar.
        </t>
      </section>
      
      <section title='Registry Synchronization State'>
        <t> The Registrar Service maintains persistent (across start-ups) state for
          synchronization purposes:
        <list style='hanging'>
          
          <t hangText='DbUpdateNumber'> 
            A monotonically increasing 64 bit signed value.  
          </t>
          
          <t> 
            The DbUpdateNumber is used to label the DB records that are modified by a DB update,
            and can be used to designate a particular state of the DB, namely, all record
            modifications with DbUpdateNumber less than or equal to some specified
            DbUpdateNumber. 
            It is incremented by the registrar for each received REGISTER request that 
            causes an update to its own registry database. DbUpdateNumber is not updated
            by synchronization operations from peer registrars; only by requests for
            which this registrar is the Primary Registrar.
          </t>

          <t>
            See <xref target='startup'>Startup Processing</xref> for how the
            DbUpdateNumber is initialized. <!-- :TODO: and incremented... -->
          </t>
       
        <t> 
          For a given registrar, DbUpdateNumbers for registrations that it handles as the
          primary registrar are referred to as "local". DbUpdateNumbers for registrations
          handled by other registrars and received via updates are referred
          to "peer". 
        </t>
        
          <t hangText='PeerReceivedDbUpdateNumber'> 
            The largest DbUpdateNumber received from the peer. 
          </t>
          <t hangText='PeerSentDbUpdateNumber'> 
            The largest value of the local DbUpdateNumber sent to the peer.
          </t>

        </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          These state variables are not persisted directly.  Rather, they are persisted
          implicitly in that they can be computed at startup from the registration database.
          See <xref target='startup'>Startup Processing</xref>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The registrar service maintains additional state that is not persistent:
          
          <list style='hanging'>
            <t hangText='PeerReachable'>
              This is a boolean that indicates whether or not the peer is
              believed to be reachable. It is initialized on startup to

              is not known to be reachable. It is set to <spanx

            The entries in the registration database maintain the state for registrations
            of contacts for Addresses Of Record. Entries are indexed by AOR, contact, and the
            Call-ID of the sequence of REGISTERs (the registration quasi-dialog) that
            establish and maintain the registration.

            Entries are considered to have expired when the current time exceeds the

            that the entry can maintain the "last CSeq seen" value for that Call-ID, in case an
            out-of-sequence REGISTER arrives. Entries are removed from the DB after one
            hour after they expire, as we assume that is long enough that
            no out-of-order REGISTERS will be received.

          Registrar processing is performed in two distinct phases stages
          -- Startup Phase and Operational Phase.
        </t>
        <t>
          The purpose of the startup phase is to recover the local
          registration database (if possible), and to resynchronize with all
          peer registrars.  Any updates are pulled from peer registrars so
          that the local registrar can tell when its database is up to date
          and that no more updates are available.  During the startup phase
          the database is not yet known to be up to date, so the
          Registry/Redirect service does not accept either any SIP request
          or any request to push updates from any peer registrar.
        </t>

        <t>
          During the operational phase, the registrar processes SIP
          messages.  Any REGISTER request that results in updates to the
          local database causes those updates to be pushed to each peer.
        </t>
        
        <t> 
          Processing is done by a number of interlocking operations which
          are detailed below. Synchronization messages between registrars
          are implemented using XML-RPC (see <xref
          target='xmlrpcsync'/>). The XML-RPC URI for these operations
          always uses the <spanx style='verb'>https</spanx> scheme (see
          <xref target='xmlrpcsec'/>), the peer host name specified by the
          SIP_REGISTRAR_SYNC_WITH configuration item, and the fixed path
          <spanx style='verb'>/RPC2</spanx>.
        </t>
        
        <section title='Startup Processing' anchor='startup'>

          <t> 
            The goal of the startup phase is to discover quickly whether or not
            the local registry is the best available source of contact
            information. Since this is not yet known, during the startup
            phase, the server does not open its SIP port.  SIP clients will
            consider it to be down and fail over to another server.
          </t>

          <t>
            In order to prevent races between the pull-based
            synchronization during the startup phase and the push-based
            synchronization used during the operational phase, the
            registrarSync.pushUpdates and registrarSync.reset methods are
            not available during the startup phase.  Attempts to invoke
            them result in XML-RPC faults, which causes the caller to
            consider the target of the request to be UnReachable.  This is
            corrected by the <xref
            target='reset'>registrarSync.reset</xref> during the <xref
            target='transition'>transition from startup to operational
            phase</xref>.
          </t>

          <t>
            The startup processing phase performs the following steps:
            <list style='numbers'>
              <t> 
                Read the local persistent registry store. If

                  <t>
                    Each PeerReceivedDbUpdateNumber is set to the largest update number
                    in the database whose associated <spanx

            RegisterSync thread propagates the resulting database updates
            to each peer.  If connectivity is lost, the RegistrarTest
            thread periodicallly attempts to reestablish contact and
            resynchronize the DbUpdateNumber values that govern update
            propagation.

            <t> 
              When a REGISTER request has been determined to be valid, the
              local DbUpdateNumber is incremented, and the changes are
              applied to the local registry database. The local
              DbUpdateNumber is recorded in each updated row in the
              registry database. The RegistrarServer thread then invokes
              the RegistrarSync.push C++ method, which signals the
              RegistrarSync thread to trigger replication to peers.
            </t>
            
            <t>
              SIP rules require that when a REGISTER message is processed
              that the effect is atomic - either all Contacts are accepted
              or none are. Note that the Primary Registrar is responsible
              for this logic, and that the effect
              of the REGISTER is reduced to the insertion/modification of a number of
              rows in the local database.  Each row is tagged with the local
              DbUpdateNumber of the new version of the DB.  The
              RegistrarSync thread propagates records based on comparing
              the update number in the row with the PeerSentDbUpdateNumber
              for the peer.  Also see <xref target='pushUpdates'>pushUpdates</xref>.
            </t>
            
            <t> 
              This transformation of the REGISTER before propagation is not
              a direct expression of the rules in RFC 3261, as it does not
              process "expire all" operations correctly in certain uncommon
              race situations.  It does however ensure that the results of
              replication are accurately defined (since the processing of
              the DB updates will produce the same result regardless of the
              order in which they are processed). Even in cases where the
              RFC 3261 result is not produced, the result is always the
              same as would be produced by the same messages if they were
              received with certain small changes in their arrival
              times. In other words, the race condition already exists in
              3261, and the registry replication does not introduce any
              problems that are not already there.

            The RegistrarTest thread is responsible for determining whether or not a
            previously UnReachable peer has become Reachable.  When a peer
            is marked UnReachable, the RegistrarTest::checkPeers C++ method
            is invoked to signal that the checks should begin.
          </t>

          <t>
            For each UnReachable peer, the RegistrarTest thread maintains a
            timer to periodically check the status of that peer.  Each time
            this timer expires, if the peer is still UnReachable (the
            status may have been changed by the peer calling
            registrarSync.reset) then RegistrarTest attempts to invoke the
            <xref target='reset'>registerSync.reset</xref> XML-RPC method
            for the peer.

            On any fault, the RegistrarTest thread resets the timer for the peer, using
            standard exponential backoff to a maximum interval of one eighth of the maximum
            registration interval. This prevents useless and possibly harmful traffic
            being injected into the network in the event that the loss of connectivity is

            A successful invocation of the registrarSync.reset method
