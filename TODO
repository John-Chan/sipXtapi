* change package names to org.sipfoundry

* Use xdoclet

* Upgrade to Jboss 3.2.X or 4.0 if it's released by then. Quick
attempts to deploy using 3.2.X resulted in the following issues:

   - Accessor methods on CMP beans must have get and sets

   - getID and setID would have to change to getId to match
     ejb-jar.xml definitions along with a few other camel-case method
     names

   - Various findXXX methods complain about not being defined

   - ConfigurationSet.setContent(String) gave complaints about have
     wrong function argument but it appeared correct.
