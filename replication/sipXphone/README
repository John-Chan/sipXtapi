sipXphone is SIP soft phone client for Microsoft Windows and Linux.  The phone 
client supports multiple simultaneous calls, hold, mute, client-mixed 
conferencing, consultative transfer, multiple line appearances, 
authentication, and an extensible java-based application environment.

sipXphone is developed under open source and hosted as part of the sipX line 
of projects available from SIPfoundry.  It is licensed under LGPL which 
allows commercial usage of the project without the "viral infection" 
associated with GPL.  Essentially, you may use the code as-is and build on
top of it without exception, however, if you modify the existing code (e.g.
bug fix), you must make changes available under LGPL.  

For more information on open source licensing or SIPfoundry, please see 
www.opensource.org or www.sipfoundry.org.

If you have questions or problems, please consult the latest version of this 
documen and the sipX user mailing list.  The sipX-user mailing list is 
searchable - please search before posting your question.

===================
Basic Configuration
===================

The sipXphone is designed to be managed remotely through the use of the 
sipXconfig configuration server or through a web browse interface.  For 
information on the configuration server, please the sipXconfig project and 
sipXpbx project documentation.  This section concentrates on browser-based 
configuration.

Enabling browser-based configuration
------------------------------------

For security reasons, the browser based configuration is disabled by default.
In future versions, the browsers based configuration will be enabled by 
restricted to use on the local machine (bound to localhost).

To enable the "Web UI", please follow these steps:
1.	Launch the sipXphone application
2.	Press the "More" Button
3.	Select "Prefs" followed by "mysip softphone Web"
4.	If you have configured an admin password enter it next; otherwise, select 
    "Ok"
5.	Check "Enable Web Server" and select a port.  The default port is 80.

Accessing browsed-based configuration
-------------------------------------

The sipXphone configuration user interface is accessed by launching a web 
browser and entering the IP address or DNS hostname of the PC running 
sipXphone.  If the sipXphone is running on the same computer, use "localhost"
in place of the DNS hostname or IP address.  For example, enter 
"http://localhost" as the browser URL .  If a different port is selected, the 
general form for the URL is http://localhost:PORT.

The browser based user interface will prompt for a username and password.  
Enter "admin" as the username and a password if you have selected one.  This
is the same password used to enable the Web Server from the sipXphone client.
The default password is blank (enter nothing).

NOTE: sipXphone must be running to access the browser-based configuration.

Defining your outbound SIP servers
----------------------------------

If you intend to dial others by anything other than IP address or hostname, 
you will need to define a proxy and/or directory server.  Generally, the same 
server is often used for both settings.  

Under the browsed-based configuration interface, select "Phone Configuration"
from the "Administration" dropdown menu.  Next, scroll down to the 
"SIP servers" section.  Your service provider or IT department should provide 
you with server names for these settings.

Directory Server (SIP_DIRECTORY_SERVERS)

A directory server provides look up services and is used for digit-based 
dialing.  When dialing by digits, sipXphone will send the call setup 
request to "sip:DIGITS@directoryserver".

Proxy Server (SIP_PROXY_SERVERS)

Proxy servers provide a number of services ranging from call routing to 
security enforcement to authentication to network based identity.  All 
new SIP requests are sent to this server before reaching their final 
destination.

Defining your SIP identity
--------------------------

sipXphone provides a method to define lines (SIP identities).   Lines are 
modeled after the LEDs found on key-system telephone handsets.  Generally, 
lines represent both outside PSTN lines and inbound queues such as the sale 
and support queue.  In sipXphone, lines are defined in terms of SIP 
identities.  Each identity is optionally configured to register with a SIP 
registrar.  The registration process allows the dynamic routing of calls to 
your PC.  Authentication credentials are configured on a per line basis.

Under the browsed-based configuration interface, select "Lines" from the 
"Preferences" dropdown menu.  Next, scroll down to the "SIP servers" 
section.  Your service provider or IT department should provide you with 
server names for these settings.

Next, select the "Add New Line" link and fill the appropriate settings.  
Define the line, select "Save" and then optionally add authentication 
credentials.

The Sip URL parameter defines both the caller ID presented when placing 
outbound calls and the name of the registrar server.

The Allow Forwarding setting control whether call forwarding applies to calls
placed on this line definition.  For example, a phone might not want to 
forward calls instantly to a personal voicemail box if the caller dialed the 
"sales" line.

The Registration parameter defines whether the line identity should register 
with a registrar or assume the registrar knows IP/hostname of the client 
(provisioned).

Authentication Credentials define a username, password, and realm for line 
identities.  To avoid hijacking calls, most SIP servers require a unique 
username and password for a SIP identity.
