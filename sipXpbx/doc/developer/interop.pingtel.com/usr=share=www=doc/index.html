<hr>

<p>
This test server is provided by <a
href='http://www.pingtel.com/'>Pingtel</a> for open interoperability
testing.  It is the Pingtel proxy software (based on the
<a href='http://www.sipfoundry.org/sipXpbx/'>sipXpbx open source project</a>)
with a <a href='#config'>custom configuration</a>.  This configuration
is designed to exercise issues we have found are important to
interoperability between User Agents and Proxies.
</p>

<p>
This server is freely available to all, <strong>but Pingtel does not
provide any free support for diagnosing problems you have with these
tests.</strong>  If you are in need of help, consulting is available
for a fee; contact &lt;<a href='mailto:%69%6E%74%65%72%6F%70%2D%63%6F%6E%66%69%67%40%70%69%6E%67%74%65%6C%2E%63%6F%6D'><b>interop-config</b><i>(at)</i><b>pingtel</b><i>(dot)</i><b>com</b></a>&gt;.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE WELL:</strong>  All communication with this server is
logged and used under the "SIPit rules":  It may be used by Pingtel for
internal testing and
development, and aggregate information may be released to other
parties.  No information identifiable to a specific user, product, or
company will be released to other parties.
</p>

<h2>Tests</h2>

<p>
The tests below are organized so that they can be used by more than
one tester at a time - if you pick your own group of extensions.  Pick
a number between 10 and 99 - in the addresses below, this group number
is shown as "<span class='group'>gg</span>".  Each group consists of 9
addresses that you can register:
<code>
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>1@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>2@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>3@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>4@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>5@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>6@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>7@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>8@interop.pingtel.com
    1<span class='group'>gg</span>9@interop.pingtel.com
</code>
When you register the first address, check the response to see if it
has any Contact addresses other than yours - if it does, please choose
another group number.
</p>

<h2>DNS SRV</h2>

<p>
The SRV records for <code>interop.pingtel.com</code> are set to prefer
TCP; your user agent should choose TCP over UDP.
</p>

<h2>Registration</h2>

<p>
The credentials for the test addresses are:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Address Of Record</dt>
  <dd><code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>n@interop.pingtel.com</code>
    <br />(for n= 1..9)
  </dd>
  <dt>User Name<dt>
  <dd><code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>n</code>
    <br />(The user part of the address)
  </dd>
  <dt>Realm<dt>
  <dd><code>interop.pingtel.com</code></dd>
  <dt>Password</dt>
  <dd><code>1234</code></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Message Waiting</h2>

<p>
The 1<span class='group'>gg</span>1 and 1<span
class='group'>gg</span>2 each has a voicemail box; they may SUBSCRIBE
for the <code>message-waiting</code> event package.  You can call the
voicemail box directly by calling user
<code>2<span class='group'>gg</span>1</code> or <code>2<span class='group'>gg</span>2</code>.
to deposit voicemail.
</p>

<h2>Transfer</h2>

<p>
A call to "<code>100@interop.pingtel.com</code>" will be answered by an
auto-attendant - when you enter a registered extension at the prompt,
the auto-attendant will transfer your call (REFER without Replaces).
</p>

<p>
If your user agent(s) can do consultative transfer (REFER with
Replaces), then you should also try that through the proxy.
</p>

<h2>Authenticated INVITE (407 Proxy Authentication Required)</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>3<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be challenged for authentication, and when successfully
authenticated will ring <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>.
</p>

<h2>Authenticated INVITE (403 Forbidden)</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>4<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be challenged for authentication, but even when authenticated
only an extension ending in 7, 8, or 9 is allowed to complete the call
(which will ring <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code>).  Any
other caller will get a 403 Forbidden response.  This allows you to
test whether or not your user interface communicates the reason for
the call failure.
</p>

<h2>Serial Forking</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code>
will be forked to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code> in some random order.  If not
answered, the first extension called will receive a CANCEL when the
next is called.  Make sure that your caller connects with the phone
that answers, and that all the others correctly clean up the
cancelled requests.
</p>

<h2>Parallel Forking</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>6<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code>
will be simultaneously forked to <code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>3</code>,
<code>1<span class='group'>gg</span>4</code>, <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>5</code>, and <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>6</code>.  When one answers, the others will
receive a CANCEL.  Make sure that your caller connects with the phone
that answers, and that all the others correctly clean up the
cancelled requests.
</p>

<h2>Long Paths / Large Messages</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>7<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will spiral several times within the proxy so that when received at <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>x</code> it will have several Vias.  This
checks your handling of large messages (if UDP, they will be fragmented).
</p>

<h2>Merged INVITE</h2>

<p>
A call to <code>8<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x 1-9)
will be forked such that two INVITE requests will be received at <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>x</code> with the same Call-Id, Cseq, and From tag
values, but different branch ids.  The UAC should accept the first one
and return a 482 Loop Detected response to the second.  Make sure that
the loop detected error is sent and that the call is correctly set up
when the called phone answers.
</p>

<h2>Hop Limit Exceeded</h2>

<p>
Any call to <code>9999</code> will return a 483 Too Many Hops.  As a
diagnostic aid, this software returns part of the failed request in
the body of the 483 response.  This allows you to test whether or not
your user interface conveys the reason for the failure (and is not
troubled by the response body).
</p>

<h2>Call Pick-Up</h2>

<p>
Any call to <code>*78xxxx</code> will pick up the call ringing on the
UA at <code>xxxx</code>.  To use this feature:
</p>

<ol>
<li>From one UA, call a second UA via <code>1<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>Leave the call ringing.</li>
<li>From a third UA, call <code>*781<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>.</li>
<li>The third UA should now be talking to the first UA, and the second
should no longer be ringing.</li>
<li>If the second UA answers the call before the third UA calls <code>*781<span
class='group'>gg</span>n</code>, the third UA should receive a
<code>404</code> response rather than connecting to the first UA.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This test should work whether or not the first or third UAs are
registered to the test server.
</p>

<p>
This test checks that the first UA correctly handles INVITE with Replaces and
the early-only option, and whether the second UA generates
dialog event notices with usable endpoint identification.
</p>

<h2>Call Park and Retrieve</h2>

<p>
The extensions <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>x</code> (for any x
1-9) are <em>parking orbits</em>.
(The extensions <code>5<span class='group'>gg</span>0</code> are used
in the Serial Forking test described above.)
If a call is transferred to a parking orbit, it will connect to the
<em>park server</em> user agent, which plays music.
A call can be retrieved from a parking orbit by calling
<code>*4xxxx</code>, where <code>xxxx</code> is the parking orbit.
If there are several calls parked on the same orbit, the one that was
parked there first is retrieved.
