<p>You configure call forwarding row parameters, directing calls to locations other than voicemail by clicking Add Number. The default is set to ring the associated extension first, and if no one answers at the extension, the call is forwarded to voicemail. You add alternate numbers to forward calls to, select "If no response" or "At the same time" as a call forwarding action, and define how long to ring the alternate number before continuing to the next row or on to voicemail for the original extension.</p>

<p>To add a number:</p>

<p>1. Click <em>Add Number</em>.</p>

<p>A row displays for selecting an action, a number to forward calls to, and how long to ring the number.</p>

<p>2. Select "If no response" or "At the same time" from the drop-down menu to initiate the call forwarding action. "If no response" means that the extension rings first and if there is no answer, the "forward to" number rings. "At the same time" means both the extension and alternate "forward to" number ring simultaneously.</p>

<p>3. Enter a number or SIP URL in the "forward to" text box where calls coming to the extension should be forwarded.</p>

<p>4. Define the length of time in seconds that the alternate number should ring in the "ring for" text box.</p>

<p>5. Click <em>OK</em> to save changes and return to the Identification screen, <em>Apply</em> to apply changes and remain at the Call Forwarding screen, or <em>Cancel</em> to return to the Identification screen without saving any changes.</p>

<p>You can delete a call forwarding row by clicking <em>Delete</em> at the right-hand side of the associated row. You can edit a call forwarding row by editing the associated row's fields and clicking <em>OK</em> or <em>Apply</em>. You can add additional call forwarding rows by clicking <em>Add Number</em>. You can only change the successive hierarchy of the call forwarding rows by directly editing the rows or deleting and recreating rows.</p>
