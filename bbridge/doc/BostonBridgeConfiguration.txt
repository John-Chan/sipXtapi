Configuration Parameters for the Boston Bridge

Global Configuration Parameters

  These parameters apply to the operation of the Boston Bridge
  Conference Service.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_LOG_LEVEL
      Maximum log severity level to be recorded.
      Defaults to NOTICE.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_RESIP_LOG_LEVEL
      Maximum resiprocte stack log severity level to be recorded.

      Defaults to DISABLED
.
   BOSTON_BRIDGE_LOG_DIR
      Directory path name for the log file.
      Defaults to SIPX_LOGDIR

   Ports for SIP usage - may be number, PORT_DEFAULT, or
   PORT_NONE (which disables use of that transport).

     BOSTON_BRIDGE_TCP_PORT - Default 5060
     BOSTON_BRIDGE_UDP_PORT - Default 5060
     BOSTON_BRIDGE_TLS_PORT - Default 5061

   Minimum and maximum UDP port numbers to be used for RTP streams.

     BOSTON_BRIDGE_RTP_START  - Default 15000
     BOSTON_BRIDGE_RTP_END    - Default 20000

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_PROXY

     An 'outbound proxy' that should be used as the first hop in any
     request originated from the bridge.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_MAX_LEGS - Default is '0' (unlimited)

     The maximum number of call legs to be allowed by this bridge.  If this
     is set and a call request is received when there are this many legs
     already active, a 486 Busy Here is returned with a Warning header
     indicating that there are too many users on the bridge.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_ENTER_SOUND - Default bbridge/join.wav

      The audio file to be played when a new call joins the
      conference.
      This may be a full or relative path; if a relative path, it is
      relative to the SIPX_DATADIR/bbridge directory.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_EXIT_SOUND - Default bbridge/exit.wav

      The audio file to be played when a call leaves the
      conference.
      This may be a full or relative path; if a relative path, it is
      relative to the SIPX_DATADIR/bbridge directory.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_HOLD_MUSIC - no default (silence)

      The audio file to be played when a call leg has been created but
      is not (for any reason) receiving the bridged conference audio
      (such as prior to the start of the conference).
      This may be a full or relative path; if a relative path, it is
      relative to the SIPX_DATADIR/bbridge directory.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_SIP_DOMAIN - defaults to the full host name of the
                              system.
      The host[:port] of the SIP URI for the registry to be used for
      the bridge.
      Unless overridden by other configuration, the host part of this
      value is used as the host part of the AOR for each conference.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_SIP_ALIASES - defaults to the IP addresses for the
                               system, and the full host name if that
                               does not match the SIP domain.

      A comma separated list of host and/or host:port values that the
      bridge should accept as references to itself (in addition to the
      BOSTON_BRIDGE_SIP_DOMAIN value)

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_COMMAND_MUTE

     The DTMF sequence to be entered by a conference participant to
     toggle the 'mute' of input from thier own call leg.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_COMMAND_END

     The DTMF sequence to be entered by a conference organizer to end
     a conference (disconnecting all participants).

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE_ACCESS

     Selects the default access control mechanism conferences:

       OPEN - no access control.  Any call to the AOR or contact
              address for the conference is accepted and immediatly
              joins the conference.

       REMOTE_ADMIT - uses the remote admissioon control scheme (see
                      RemoteAdmissionControl.txt for a description of
                      this scheme and its configuration parameters).

     (other schemes may be defined).

Conference Configuration Parameters

   A conference is created by setting parameters whose names include the
   name of the conference (see BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE_STATUS.<name>).

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE_STATUS.<name> - no default.
      The <name> value must match the Perl regexp:
          '^[A-Za-z0-9_]{1,32}$'
      unless overwridden by other configuration, the <name> token is
      used as the user part of the AOR for the conference.

      Controls the status of a conference; this may have the following values:
        CONFIGURE  - Instantiates the name of the conference, but does
                     start it - only configuration operations are
                     allowed.  In this state, the conference does not
                     originate or accept any SIP signaling or RTP.

        AVAILABLE  - Set when the conference has been configured and
                     may accept calls (subject to the access controls
                     configured for the conference).

   The configuration of each conference is a set of parameters that
   all begin with 'BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>'.  Different
   conference types may use different parameter names with this
   prefix..

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.AOR
     The SIP URI (may include the full name-addr value) this conference
     should register and use as its AOR.  The default is the conference
     <name> token as the user part with the BOSTON_BRIDGE_SIP_DOMAIN host
     part.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.REGISTER
     A boolean (ENABLED or DISABLED) value; whether or not the
     conference should attempt to register its AOR.

     The authentication information to be used for registration of the
     conference:

     BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.REGISTER_USERNAME
       Defaults to <name>
     BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.REGISTER_PASSWORD
       Defaults to the empty string.
     BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.REGISTER_REALM
       Defaults to whatever realm is sent in the challenge.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.ACCESS - default OPEN

       Selects the access control mechanism for this conference.
       Default is BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE_ACCESS; the same values are
       used.

   BOSTON_BRIDGE_CONFERENCE.<name>.MAX_LEGS - Default is BOSTON_BRIDGE_MAX_LEGS

     Limits the number of legs allowed in the conference.
