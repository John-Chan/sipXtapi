The package that allows third party developers to change time critical actions 
or decisions in the system.

<p>
Hooks are time critical actions or decisions that can be changed by 3rd party
developers. The system provides a default implementation; however, developers
can supplement and/or replace the default behavior by installing a hook with
the HookManager.  
</p>

<p>
When the system attempts to perform an action that has a related hook, the
systems proceeds through the list of registered hooks of that type ("hook 
chain"). The chain is ordered by when the hook was installed. For example, 
the first hook installed of type HOOK_RINGER is evaluated when there is an
incoming call. It is possible for a hook to tell the system to stop 
traversing the list of hooks, or "terminate" its evaluation of other hooks
further down in the list ("downstream") of registered hooks of this type.

NOTE: A hook will be uninstalled if it throws an exception.

The xpressa phone offers hooks for the following decisions and actions:

<table border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Call Filter
        </td>
        <td>
            This Call Filter allows an application to accept, reject, or redirect an 
            incoming call.
        </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>
            Caller ID
        </td>
        <td>
            The Caller ID hook provides identify information of callers and callees.
            This information is later displayed to the end user in of the 
            core phone forms (call in progress, incoming call, waiting for
            call, etc.).
        </td>    
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>
            Dialplan Match
        </td>
        <td>
            The Dialplan Match hooks allows developers to determine when a dialing string 
            matches a known/good dialing plan.  The xpressa phone uses this
            information to preempt digit collection when dialing. Developers 
            can also adjust or reform the dialing string/address as needed.
        </td>    
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
        <td>
            Ringer
        </td>
        <td>
            The Ringer hook defines the visual or auditory alert presented to the 
            end user for an incoming call.
        </td>    
    </tr>
    
</table>
