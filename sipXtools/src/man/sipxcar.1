.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

\fBsipxcar\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [packages|\fIfiles\fP|patch \fIfiles\fP \.\.\.]
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
Since sipX v3.4, on rpm based system, a pristine copy of every 
configuration file is tucked away in various archives. This utility 
uses those archives to assist common configuration operations.
.PP
It is useful before an upgrade to see what configuration \fIfiles\fP have 
been modified and may need be reviewed after an upgrade.
.PP
It is also useful any time to inspect your current state of 
configuration \fIfiles\fP. You will have convienent way to reset any or all 
configuration \fIfiles\fP back to factory defaults.
.PP
Lastly, it is useful to capture the configuration differences on one system
and transfer them to another system mergeing the other system current
configuration. As with all merging operations, there is the risk on conflicts
or worse, merges that produce an invalid configuration. You should review
the differences (patch file) before apply and backup configuration.
