Accessing web GUI
==========================

Normally, this is run under sipXpbx script, but if you want to launch
the services manually, you can run the following:

  # start postgres if it's not already started
  sudo -u sipxchange startrmireg.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilepublisher.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilewriter.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilegenerator.sh &

Then you can access the web gui from this url

  http://localhost:8080/pds
