   This is initial instructions to setup sipXconfig post installation

Running with sipXpbx and sipXproxy

   Install the sipXpbx project and follow instructions for starting the
   sipxpbx service. This will start and stop the necessary components of
   the configuration system. The sipXproxy will direct SIP messages to
   the Profile Publisher's automatically.

Running without sipXproxy

   SIP messages to the ProfilePublisher are proxies by the sipXproxy
   project to the corrent SIP port. If you wish to run the configserver
   w/o the sipXpbx or sipXproxy servers installed, then edit file:
   /etc/sipxpbx/config.defs and set following setting to read the
   following values:
    CONFIG_SERVER_SIP_PORT=5060

Running without sipXppbx

   To start all the components of sipXconfig, launch the services
   manually by running the following commands:
  sudo -u sipxchange startrmireg.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilepublisher.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilewriter.sh &
  sudo -u sipxchange profilegenerator.sh &

Accessing web GUI

   Then you can access the web gui from url: http://localhost:8080/pds

Initial Setup of Domain

   First thing you'll want to do is setup your system with a domain, at
   login prompt, type the following user name and password
  user name: installer
  password : password

   Here's a sample of information on next screen
 Organization : Acme Corp.

   Unless your machine's hostname is 'sipxchange' I suggest using fully
   qualified hostname here (e.g myhost.acme.com)
 DNS Domain   : myhostname.acme.com
 PIN          : ****
