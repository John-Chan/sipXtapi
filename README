   This is initial instructions to setup sipXconfig post installation. If
   you've installed from source, you should add /usr/local/sipx/bin to
   your PATH environment variable.

Accessing web GUI

   Then you can access the web gui from url: http://localhost:8080/pds

Initial Setup of Domain

   First thing you'll want to do is setup your system with a domain, at
   login prompt, type the following user name and password
  user name: installer
  password : password

   Here's a sample of information on next screen
 Organization : Acme Corp.

   Unless your machine's hostname is 'sipxchange' I suggest using fully
   qualified hostname here (e.g myhost.acme.com)
 DNS Domain   : myhostname.acme.com
 PIN          : ****

   For more information, see the sipXconfig manual built in
   doc/manual/index.html which is text-based web browser friendly.
